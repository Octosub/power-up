It creates a metaphysical space that causes the victims to receive all kinds of stimuli and information endlessly, restraining their thought processes and actions. In terms of raw strength, Satoru's domain is equal to Sukuna's own Malevolent Shrine on the inside, only losing due to Malevolent Shrine's open domain that allowed Sukuna to destroy the barrier of Unlimited Void. Satoru's skill with his Domain Expansion is so great that he can precisely control the range and time of it's activation for only 0.2 seconds, limiting its lasting effect on those he traps within it, and is able to freely change the conditions of Unlimited Void's barrier.

After giving him the key to the basement, Grisha injected a struggling Eren with a serum, which transformed him into a 4 meter Pure Titan with short rugged hair and a skinny body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan. Years later, during the first Battle of Trost, Eren was eaten alive by a Titan, and inside the stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. The sight combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into his Titan form for the first time.
  ", category: "transformation"}, {name: "Martial Arts", description: "Originally, Eren's only noteworthy trait was his natural physical strength, which stemmed from having to defend his friend Armin from bullies who were bigger and stronger. As he grew and joined the 104th squad, he trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat. After additional training with Reiner and Annie, Eren's prowess and skill set diversified, including the use of punches, throws, grappling and submission locks. He had the best scores for hand-to-hand combat of the entire 104th graduate squad. While hand-to-hand fighting would appear useless due to the massive physical differences between humans and Titans, these skills gave Eren a powerful edge when fighting other Titans in his own Titan form.", category: "strength"}],

He has made numerous discoveries and invented numerous gadgets and substances. He seems to specialize in robotics above all else, and can easily work through or around most obstacles. Long-term planning, deception, and manipulation are effortless tasks for Rick, and he is skilled at recognizing deception, such as when he saw through a three-layered simulation and pretended to fall for it in order to eliminate his captors, or when he simultaneously destroyed the Council of Ricks, collapsed the Federation, and triggered his daughter's divorce in one fell swoop.", category: "mental"}, {name: "Cybernetic Enhancement", description: "Rick was shown to have extensive cybernetic enhancements, however Rick has gone through and swapped multiple bodies, so it is unlikely that they were all enhanced.", category: "equipment"}],

When used in full, Itachi was surrounded by a spectral warrior that would protect him from damage. In addition to the chakra swords and Yasaka Magatama common to all Susanoo, Itachi's Susanoo wielded the Sword of Totsuka an ethereal sword with the ability to seal any person it pierced into its gourdâhilt and the Yata Mirror a shield that was said to reflect any attack by changing its chakra nature to counterbalance an attack.

However, in the Spider-Man: The New Animated Series episode The Party, Peter spun organic webs from in front of both his wrists below his hands at Electro's hands, temporary blocking his ability to fire electricity, and in the Spider-Man 3 video game, it completely wraped around and smothered the Mad Bomber's small bombs to prevent an explosion from increasing, and only a little bit of the webbing was torn, in the 616 universe where it had so much power that the webbing was able to wrap and completely cover one of Iron Man's armors, catch a crashing helicopter, and was so insulated that it blocked an electrical current attack from Electro. The organic webbing takes a week to dissolve, instead of an hour. Kaine Parker is also seen to have this ability.", category: "equipment"}],

From this, Naruto can use his mass scale of clones to drastically speed up his training to gain years worth of experience in just days. By the time he became Hokage, Naruto's usage of this technique on mass-scale and prolonged-periods allowed him to constantly perform multiple simultaneous tasks throughout the village daily, although he does have a tendency to overexert himself, leaving him exhausted afterwards.", category: "summon"}, {name: "Rasengan", description: "Naruto's second trademark technique is the Rasengan. Originally, due to his poor chakra control, Naruto had to use a shadow clone to form the spherical shape while he provided the chakra. Over time, Naruto developed larger versions of the Rasengan and learned how to perform it faster. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he learned to use the Rasengan and its variants unaided with a single hand, or even form one in both hands simultaneously.
